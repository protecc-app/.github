If you've managed to stumble upon this, expect nothing.
I will never release this to the public in my lifetime.

What this project is:
 - Entirely written for fun and learning
 - Written primarily in rust
 - Automated DRM platform (website, backend, and everything else)

I disagree with DRM, hence why I'll never publicly release this, regardless of if it's actually good or bad. [link](https://creativecommons.org/2017/07/09/terrible-horrible-no-good-bad-drm/)

From a customer standpoint:
 - Why buy a $10-20 plugin that you'll likely depend on, when there's always the running risk of your (probably terrible, I can almost garuntee it's been bypassed) DRM service going down and no promise of being able to actually use it past then even IF you purchased it.
